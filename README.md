# Vruddha Mitra 🌼

**Vruddha Mitra** is a volunteer visit booking platform aimed at connecting kind-hearted individuals with elderly people in need of company and care. This web app allows volunteers to browse elder profiles and schedule meaningful visits with them.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## 🚀 Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the app by modifying app/page.js. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Geist, a new font family by Vercel.
